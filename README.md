This project demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot with Keycloak, a popular open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution, using Gradle as the build tool. The project showcases how to secure a Spring Boot RESTful API as a resource server using Keycloak for authentication and authorization (**Route** and **Method** based).

## Features:

**Secure RESTful API:** Protects endpoints or methods of a Spring Boot application with Keycloak security. <br>
**Keycloak Integration:** Demonstrates how to configure Spring Boot to work with Keycloak as an Identity Provider (IdP).<br>
**Gradle Build:** Utilizes Gradle as the build tool for managing dependencies and building the project.

## Technologies Used:

**Spring Boot:** Provides the foundation for building secure, production-grade applications. <br>
**Keycloak:** Offers powerful IAM capabilities, including single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration. <br>
**Gradle:** Facilitates project management, dependency resolution, and building Java applications.

## Getting Started:

**Clone Repository:** Clone the keycloak-resource-server repository to your local machine. <br>
**Configure Keycloak:** Set up a Keycloak instance and define a realm, client, and user roles.<br>
**Configure Spring Boot:** Update the Spring Boot application properties to specify the Keycloak realm, client ID, and issuer URI.<br>
**Run Application:** Start the Spring Boot application and verify the integration with Keycloak.<br>
**Explore Endpoints:** Access the secured endpoints of the RESTful API and observe the Keycloak authentication & authorization process.
